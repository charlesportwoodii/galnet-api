# Systems

System information can be queried for by searching against the ```/systems``` endpoint. This endpoint supports pagination via the ```page``` parameter. Systems by default are sorted in alphanumeric order by their name, but this can be changed by specifying the ```sort``` paramtered with the parameter name and the order ```asc|desc```.

```
GET /systems?sort=id&order=asc
GET /systems?sort=name&orderdesc
```

This endpoint also supports direct searching against the following properties

```
government
allegiance
state
security
needs_permit // use 0 or 1 for boolean properties
```

```
GET /systems?id=105
GET /systems?needs_permit=1&state=Boom
```

Additionally, the following properties support searching.

```
name
faction
primary_economy
```

```
GET /systems?name=10
GET /systems?name=10 Tauri
GET /systems?name=CD-51&allegiance=Empire
```

Finally, you can also sort by population by specifying the population directly, by specifying a ```populationMap``` parameter, which will filter systems with a population using one of the valid query parmeters```>=, >, =, <, <=```.

```
GET /systems?population=100000&populationMap=>=
```

Feel free to mix and match multiple query parameters for complex searches. Data from this endpoint will list information for that system, and all stations currently in the system.

# System details by ID

To see information for a specific system, request that system directly using it's ```id```

```
GET /systems/100
```

> Note: the systems endpoint does not show all information for a station. To view more information about a station, request that station directly

# Nearby Systems

GNA can also show the closest 15 systems to a given system by it's ID by issuing the following request

```
GET /systems/<id>/nearby
```

## Examples

```
GET /systems/11065/nearby # Systems near Kou Hua
GET /systems/16916/nearby # Systems near Sif
```

> Note, building the kdTree necessary to display this information is extremely time consuming. Consequently, nearby system data is data is only cleared on import.
